      "desc:8": "The §aBeam Former§r is an alternative to using ME Cable.\n\nPlace one at each end of a straight run, and it will form a beam between them! This beam will send the AE singal between each side.\n\nThe beam has a range of §e32 blocks§r between the endpoints, not including them.\n\nThese beams also have the GT bloom effects too!\n\nIf the beam is blocked, the connection will un-form. Doing this using redstone (such as pistons) technically makes it possible to shut off different sections of the system, but doing so can be §claggy§r. As an extension of this, avoid the toggle bus as well - it has the same problem.\n\nWalking through the beam does not block it!",
