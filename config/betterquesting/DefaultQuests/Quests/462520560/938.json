It does cause quite a few bugs... You may or may not destroy the TPS, or end up having thousands of tools being crafted as soon as one of them breaks.\nIf you §oreally§r want to use GT tools in AE2 autocrafting, dump some of them with high durability, but do not setup autocrafting for the tools themselves.\nInstead, use the alternate §3Assembling Machine§r recipes.",
