      "desc:8": "You may notice that some fluids say they are \"Acidic\", with §9Sulfuric Acid§r being one of them.\n\nThis means that many fluid pipes will not be able to transport them safely!\nAt §bMV§r, the cheapest pipes for acid transportation are probably §aGold§r, with the more expensive §aVanadium Steel§r or §aChrome§r pipes taking second place and third place.\n§aStainless Steel§r or §aPolytetrafluoroethylene§r will be valid options once you are in §6HV§r.\n\nYou have three options for acid storage at around this point: §dGlass Vials§r, §dGold Drums§r, or §dSuper Tanks§r. Glass Vials are like §9Fluid Cells§r, and are made to store acids. Gold Drums are self-explanatory. Super Tanks will be unlocked after §9Polyethylene§r, and can store any fluid without restriction.\n\n§cWARNING:§r Acids in the wrong pipes will cause §cvoiding§r, §cpipe burning§r, and high rates of §cdeath§r! Be careful!\n\n§bLore:§r The acid transportation and storage mechanics originate from GregTech 6. Fun!",
