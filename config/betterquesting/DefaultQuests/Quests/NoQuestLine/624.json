Glass Vials are like §9Fluid Cells§r, and are made to store acids. Gold Drums are self-explanatory. Super Tanks will be unlocked after §9Polyethylene§r, and can store any fluid without restriction.\n\n§cWARNING:§r Acids in the wrong pipes will cause §cvoiding§r, §cpipe burning§r, and high rates of §cdeath§r! Be careful!\n\n§bLore:§r The acid transportation and storage mechanics originate from GregTech 6. Fun!",
