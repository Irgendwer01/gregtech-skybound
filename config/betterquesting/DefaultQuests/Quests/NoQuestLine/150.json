I hope you got it!§r\n\nThe §3Battery Buffer§r handles §9two Amps in§r, and §9one Amp out§r §dper Battery§r. Output side has the dot, all other sides are inputs.\n§6It will also charge both EU and RF Tools inside it§r.\n\nThis is a must have if you don\u0027t have unlimited power at hand.\n\nGet §eany§r LV Battery Buffer to complete this quest. However the 16 slots variant is a bit overkill at this stage. You\u0027ll probably want a 4 slot buffer to start with for your machines, and a second 4 slot buffer which you can make later for your EBF. Make sure you understand why by the end of the LV chapter!\n\n§9Note:§r Do not loop your lossy Cables back to your Battery Buffer, you will end up voiding energy!\n\n§bLore:§r To be frank with you, the GTCE Battery Buffer was mediocre. It has been reworked by yours truly to provide a mix between GT5 and GTCE\u0027s functionality. Energy now splits evenly across all batteries!",
