Use it for passive setups such as Ore Processing or Oil Distilling.\n§9-§r §6Distinct buses§r: a §3PA§r can accept up to 10 §3Input Buses§r. Use it for your pattern automation with §3Extruder§r, §3Engraver§r, and many other.\n\n\n§9Note:§r With §2Gregicality Multiblocks§r installed, the §3PA§r can be fully replaced with all the specialized Multiblocks instead. That\u0027s for you if you hate 3x3 blue cubes, or if you hate crafting numerous low tier machines.\n\n\n§bLore:§r In GregTech 5, the Data Orb was used to Matter Replicator to store data of the material you wanted to replicate. There is no replication here, the Orb is just a crafting component.\nAdditionally GregTech 5\u0027s PA and other Multiblocks acted as a Cleanroom. There is no such thing here. You will need to place Multiblocks in the Cleanroom.",
