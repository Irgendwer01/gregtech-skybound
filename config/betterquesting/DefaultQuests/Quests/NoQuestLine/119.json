You can also right-click with a §5Screwdriver§r, or shift-right-click on another face using the grid.\n\nFor the Covers transferring Items/Fluids, you will have a button to enable/disable other forms of transfer through the cover:\n§9- §rDisabled: only the cover will be allowed to transfer on this machine side.\n§9-§r Allow Filtered (only relevant with a filter!): other transfer will be enabled only if it matches the filter\n§9-§r Allow Unfiltered: any other transfer is allowed on this machine side.\n\nPlacing a cover of a lower voltage tier on a machine is §9safe§r.",
