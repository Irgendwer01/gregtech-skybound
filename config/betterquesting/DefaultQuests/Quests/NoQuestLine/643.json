Note that this does NOT include a jetpack without the advanced upgrade.\n\n§9Leggings:§r Provides the speed boost which the Nano leggings did not.\n\n§9Boots:§r Provides §dStep Assist§r, nullifies fall damage, and increases jump height!\n\n§bLore:§r This armor is originally inspired by IndustrialCraft, but its first implementation within the GTCE environment came with Nuke Powered Utils, an addon mod to GTCE.",
