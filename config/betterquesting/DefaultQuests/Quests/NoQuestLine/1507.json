The §dHydrogen§r may be looped, so reproduce §dHydrochloric Acid§r locally, that way you will only have to passively input §aIron Dusts§r and §aChlorine§r.\n\n§9-§r One §3LCR§r for both the §acoated Boards§r and the §aempty Circuit Boards§r to make §ecrafting Requests§r with AE2 extremely easy. Keeping an Input Hatch filled with Sulfuric Acid shouldn\u0027t be a problem, either.",
