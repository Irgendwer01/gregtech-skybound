Thanks to it, you can turn §6one Ingot into two Rods§r, and §6one Bolt into one screw§r. That\u0027s twice the efficiency on those recipes as opposed to crafting.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The GregTech 5 Lathe produces one Rod and 2 small piles of Dust per Ingot. We also have a setting for this in GTCEu, but it\u0027s turned off by default.\nThe Gregtech 6 Lathe acts like GT5\u0027s but bolts lathe into one screw and one 1/72 pile of dust. Cursed!",
