Do not feel guilt.§r\n\nMaking §dLuV§r Components will require more work.\nThe §3Assembly Line§r is an entry point towards late game.\n\nThis Multiblock has a §evariable size§r§r. Each §3ULV Input Bus§r accepts a different stack of items.\nYou will want to build this with a size of §d10§r to get started, or of a size of §d14§r to accept all possible recipes.\n\nRecipes require §aFluids§r, so it is a good idea to keep the §3Input Hatches§r permanently filled with §dSoldering Alloy§r, §dLubricant§r and §dStyrene-Butadienne Rubber§r.\n\n§6Read the next quests to learn the mechanics of the Assembly Line. This multiblock is §lcomplicated§r§6 but very fun.",
