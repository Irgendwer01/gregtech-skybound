This is outside of the optimal chain for Byproducts, but this is also the cheapest Ore Processing machine of this set to run and to setup on a small scale.\n\n\n§bLore:§r In base GTCE, this was the strongest Ore Processing machine as it was fairly easy to use, and gave three tiny dusts, just like the Ore Washer or the Thermal Centrifuge. We tuned it down in favor of diversity.",
