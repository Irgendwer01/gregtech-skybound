      "desc:8": "§oThe §3Large Boiler§r is an §6optional§r big boy variant of the Small Boilers. It runs off solid or liquid fuel.\n\nIf you want Steam-based power production, this will be your choice. Other power options are listed in the §bMV§r Chapter.\n\n\n§cImportant:§r This Boiler can also §cexplode§r similarly to the regular Boilers! I would like to say the explosion is not kind... but it\u0027s configured to not damage blocks or entities on this modpack.\n§cWater supply is crucial§r. Dedicate a §3Primitive Pump§r with a LV Output Hatch in the §lsame chunk§r as the Boiler. Any biome will still be enough to supply enough water.\n\n\nOnce fully heated up, the §3LBB§r produces 800 Steam per tick, which is §d400EU/t§r after conversion, or 12.5 Basic Steam Turbines! This (relatively!) immense power comes at the cost of §la lot§r of burnable fuel.\n§5§lBut§r the +/- buttons in the GUI let you §9throttle§r the Boiler, down to 25% power for 200 Steam per tick. That is §d100EU/t§r, or slightly above 3 Basic Steam Turbines.\n\n\n§9Note:§r Informations about Multiblocks are given after you get the §3Electric Blast Furnace§r. I recommend you get that first.",
