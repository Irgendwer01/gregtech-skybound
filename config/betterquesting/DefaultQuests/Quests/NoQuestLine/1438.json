      "desc:8": "§oNitric Acid does not eat your skin unlike most acids, but its fumes are extremely toxic! It is also a very potent oxidizer. Extremely dangerous.§r\n\n§aNitric Acid§r is used in:\n§9-§r Cetane-Boosted Diesel, a better Diesel fuel presented in a next Quest.\n§9-§r Nitrobenzene, a better Gas fuel presented in a next Quest.\n§9-§r The optional gem slurry chains.\n§9-§r The Platinum Group Sludge chain, in §1IV§r Age.\n§9-§r Polybenzimidazole (almost bit my tongue), in §1IV§r Age.\n\n\nThere are two main ways to make §aNitric Acid§r. §oThe good way and the bad ways!§r\n\nSo naturally I will present the best method:\nGet a §3Large Chemical Reactor§r and use it to make §aNitrogen Dioxide§r.\nFrom there, react it in a regular §3Chemical Reactor§r with more §dOxygen§r and §dWater§r and you got yourself some §aNitric Acid§r!\n\nThis requires a lot of §dOxygen§r. Refer to its own Quest in §7LV§r for the most efficient ways to obtain in large amount. Notice that this is Hydrogen free!",
