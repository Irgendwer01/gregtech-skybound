You can use other fluid containers in the recipe, like Wooden Barrels, to make this easier.\n\n§9Note 2:§r Make a Sugar Cane manual farm.\n\n§9Note 3:§r As a reminder, Bone Meal can be used on Sugar Canes.\n\n§9Note 4:§r In LV Age, you will be able to make Paper from Wood, if you want more.\n\n§9Note 5:§r The Crafting Station makes this microcrafting absolutely trivial, use it!\n\n§9Note 6:§r Paper will be used as a poor wrapping material for the upcoming resistors.\n\n§9Note 7:§r I have a pleasure to share this moment with you, fellow Greg enjoyer.\n\n§9Note 8:§r If you didn\u0027t notice the meme reference in the quest title and the italics... Nothing will happen, let\u0027s move on.",
