      "desc:8": "§oHave you seen the Oil spouts when wandering around, or mined into a deposit of Oil?§,§r\n\nGet a §3Pump§r, place it above an Oil spout and Power it!\n\nEach Oil deposit can have between §63,000§r and §69,200§r buckets of Oil, which is huge! Refining the Oil§r onsite into either §aLight Fuel§r or §aDiesel§r (or both) is perfectly viable. Next Quests explain what they are good for.\nStore this into §3Drums§r, but you will truly want to use a §3Super Tank§r as soon as you unlock it.\n\n§cWarning: §rDo not forget to §dchunkload§r with FTB Utilities (open the map in the top left corner, claim the chunks with left-click, and enable force loading with shift-left-click).\n\n\n§\n§9§lNote:§r§l The Oil path is one path towards §9§lEthylene§r§l. The other paths involve Trees and Plants.§r§r\nFor now, Oil is §doptional§r. But it will become mandatory starting with §5EV§r Age, much later.\n\nOil can also be refined in the form of §aLight Fuel§r, §aDiesel§r or even §aGasoline§r, which are excellent power options.\nIf you chose this path, you should use it for both Power and Ethylene.\n\nOil spouts are a §6great starting point§r, they will help transition to Fluid Drilling Rigs.\n\n\n§bLore:§r Oil geysers were originally from Buildcraft. If you played a GregTech 5 modpack without Buildcraft, you needed to use the Fluid Rig and tap randomly to try and get lucky... or wait until HV age to do a rudimentary prospection.",
