The §3Solid Boiler§r is the only available Boiler for now, as the Glass needed for the others is not available. Make one, or two.\n\n§cImportant:§r Boilers can §cexplode§r! Water does not mess too well with high temperatures, and a steam explosion may occur under the following conditions:\n§9-§r The Boiler is hot, shown by the red bar in the GUI\n§9AND\n-§r The Boiler has no water, signified by the absence of blue bar\n§9AND\n-§r The Boiler receives water§r\n\nYou can be perfectly safe by filling the boiler with water before heating it up, and making sure it has water constantly. The drain is slow - §a1 mB§r of Water boils into §a160 mB§r of Steam - so you don\u0027t have to worry too much.\n\nThe Boiler will auto eject steam on all faces except bottom. For automated Water input, use the bottom face.\n\n\n§9Note:§r In this modpack, explosions are configured to not damage any block or entity, but you still lose your machine!",
