You will also need about a stack each of Invar and Steel.\n\nNote that §aCupronickel§r can be made in the §9Alloy Smelter§r. It\u0027s much faster than mixing!\n\n\nThe Cupronickel Coils will allow the EBF to perform recipes up to §d1,800K§r (ignoring Voltage bonuses). That\u0027s pretty hot if you ask me.",
