This machine exists mainly for §9automation§r purposes, save for unpacking Cables and a few other things.\n\n\n§bLore§r: You might wonder why this quest is in the Ore Processing section, the quest reward and the mentions of Tiny Dusts are a hint. In earlier versions of GTCEu, Ore Processing used to give Byproducts as a static amount of Tiny Dusts instead of a chance at a full Dust, so you\u0027d use a packager to combine them into full Dusts.\n\n§bMore Lore§r: In GTCE, the reverse operation required a separate machine, the Unpackager.",
