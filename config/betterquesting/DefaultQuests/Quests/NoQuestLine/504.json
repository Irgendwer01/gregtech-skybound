When looking through recipes, pin them in §2JEI§r (default \u0027A\u0027 hotkey). I hope you have been doing that this whole time, as it makes planning a lot easier!\n\n§aPBI§r only becomes mandatory to progress from §dLuV§r to ZPM, but having it made earlier will unlock the §6Advanced SMDs§r.\n\nThe Quest asks for PBI Plates, however you may want Bars for automation purposes.",
