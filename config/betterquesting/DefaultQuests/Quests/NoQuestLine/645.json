Instead of standard silicon wafers, these rely on §9Emerald§r or §9Olivine§r.\n\nGetting your first Crystal Chips will be difficult, so you may wish to invest in a high-tier autoclave. After you get your first Chip, you can duplicate them with §9Europium§r. Don\u0027t worry about those other recipes yet, they\u0027re for later on in §cZPM§r.\n\n§eNote§r: An §9Advanced Item Detector§r cover will be useful for automating these. They work just like the Advanced Energy Detector.\n\n§bLore§r: In GT5u modpacks, making your first Crystal Chips required the autoclave to be in Low Gravity, which meant doing this process on a Galacticraft Space Station, or on the moon!",
