We have put it here in the name of completeness, but if this is not useful to you, feel free to skip it.§r\n\nThe §3Rock Breaker§r generates different types of igneous Rocks. In order to operate, §9Water§r and §cLava§r (doesn\u0027t need to be source blocks) must both be adjacent to it. Those rocks might be pulverized and electrolyzed into certain materials.\n\nCertain rocks, such as §b§cRed Granite§r, need up to §5EV§r power to generate.\n\n§eAny§r Rock Breaker will complete this Quest.\n\n§bLore§r: Obsidian requiring Redstone to generate is in reference to an ancient Minecraft bug, §7MC-4239§r. Placing Redstone where the Cobblestone would go in a cobble generator would make it generate Obsidian instead. This bug was resolved in snapshot 14w25b for Minecraft 1.8, over 7 years ago at the time of writing!",
