      "desc:8": "§oGregTech cannot yet provide ways to farm plants or trees, so here we come with a custom multiblock for the modpack!§r\n\nThe multiblock §3Greenhouse§r will be your source of §aWood§r, and other plants if you wish.\n\nThe §aWood§r production is enough to keep running §32 Pyrolyse Ovens§r at their lowest Power.\nYou can also use this for automated §aResin§r. The yields are kept low to incentivize other rubber sources, later in the game.\n\n§9Note: §rWith §d40EU/t§r recipes, it needs either 1 §bMV§r energy hatch or 2 LV energy hatches. Multiblocks will §cnot§r use 2A of one tier to reach the next one for recipe voltage minimums. \nIn other words, the controller needs to say at least \"§bMV§r\" in the gui to run recipes which say \"§bMV§r\" in JEI, even if they can draw enough EU/t with a lower tier hatch configuration.\n\n§9Note:§r The structure requires a lot of §9Wrought Iron§r. Make sure you have an §3Arc Furnace§r for that.\n\n\n§bLore:§r We originally implemented a Chemical Reactor recipe for wood in the modpack to give options to the players. However they turned out to be completely busted, so we decided that a rebalance was due. I wonder if that\u0027s still busted? Probably less than the Fluid Rig!",
