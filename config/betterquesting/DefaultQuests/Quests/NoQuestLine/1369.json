Among the other fuel options, they are the easier to set up which makes them excellent to get started. However they cannot be refined further, so upgrading the §3Fluid Drilling Rig§r may be a top priority if you stick to this fuel source.\n\n§aMethane§r can also be obtained from a few §anatural sources§r. Between you and me, they are memes, but you can explore them if you wish. Ultimately, your power source is your choice.",
