They will void stuff you don\u0027t want, fancy!\n\nFor machines, it will only void in the Output slots. The Input slots are ignored.\nYou can attach a §aFilter§r for more precise voiding.\n\nAn advanced version also exists, which requires a §dMV Circuit§r. It enables voiding above a set threshold (great for for overflow control).\n\n§9Note:§r They default as being turned off, to prevent accidental voiding. Right-click them with a §5Soft Mallet§r to activate them.\n\nObtaining §eany§r Voiding Cover will complete this Quest.",
