It is completely optional, but pretty rewarding.\n\n\n§lBut§r the real topic of this Quest is here:\n§aSodium Persulfate§r and §aIron III Chloride§r are used to make cheaper §9Good Circuit Boards§r, as it cuts the Silver amount by a factor of four.\nThey are also §drequired§r to make §9Plastic Circuit Boards§r.\n\nMaking §aSodium Persulfate§r will yield §aHydrochloric Acid§r as a coproduct, which you may re-use to make §aIron III Chloride§r. This should the best approach right now, but the decision is entirely yours.\nWith more automation later in the game, Iron III Chloride will be the cheaper and more straight forward path.\n\n\nThis Quest can be completed with §eeither§r Fluid.",
