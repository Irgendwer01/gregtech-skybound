Copper is §dCu§r, Tin is §dSn§r, Iron is §dFe§r, and you can consult a §dperiodic table§r for most of the others.\n\nThis quest can be completed with §eeither§r metal, so you can claim as the reward the metal you\u0027re missing. Be sure to find a source of both soon though, as you will need a lot of both to get through the Steam Age.",
