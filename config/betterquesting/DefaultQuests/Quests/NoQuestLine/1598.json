Either electrolyze a lot of water using several §3LV Electrolyzer§r for the best energy efficiency, or recycle your unused §dhydrocarbons§r such as Methane.\n\n§9Tip:§r You can make this setup compact by having one single §3Centrifuge§r and using a §6Fluid Regulator§r set to §dSupply Exact 1,000§r.",
