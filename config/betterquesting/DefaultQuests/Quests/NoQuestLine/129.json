Here is a tip to set goals: check a lategame item and go from there. So let\u0027s say Fusion Controller Mark 3... Nevermind, let\u0027s check a closer goal instead. The §3Electric Blast Furnace§r, the main end goal of LV Age.\n\nThe EBF is expensive, which is why you should focus first on machines making materials cheaper. Quests will keep helping you for that.\n\nOther important goals are the §3Assembling Machine§r and §aMV Circuits§r.\n\n\nTalking about goals to note down, take this Clipboard. You will appreciate it.",
