Regularly come back to the §9\"Tips and Tricks\" Tab§r if you feel like you forgot something.\n\n\nQuest outlines are merely the main goals. §6Every single Quest is extremely important or provides crucial Information§r. §cIf something is optional, it will be stated§r.\n\n\nModpack can be played on §dPeaceful§r, and we recommend you to do so. You may also use the keepInventory Gamerule and abuse minimap teleport as you see fit. This modpack is not focusing on survival.\n\n\nMake good use of §2JEI§r. Items have several recipes, so do not stop at the first displayed. Identify patterns in autogenerated recipes (example: all the Iron related items macerating into Iron Dusts). When complex recipes arise, we will make sure to §6guide you§r through the best path to a product.",
