This allows you to provide far more computation to your §aResearch Station§r.\n\nHPCAs can be connected to §3Network Switches§r with transmission and reception hatches, and then the Network Switch can output to a §aResearch Station§r with another transmission hatch.\n\nHPCAs cannot connect to §3Network Switches§r by default, and each connected HPCA requires an §3HPCA Bridge Component§r to enable this functionality.",
