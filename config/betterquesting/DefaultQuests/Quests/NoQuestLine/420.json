We won\u0027t judge in this tech-focused pack!\n\n§9The End§r has even more new veins and materials to harvest, such as §ePlatinum§r and §7Naquadah§r! Also, like Nether ores, End ores are §6worth two Overworld ores§r.\n\n§aEyes of Ender§r are additionally used in crafting certain components, or for creating §5Quantum Eyes§r.\n\nThis quest will print the §alocation of the nearest Stronghold§r in chat.
