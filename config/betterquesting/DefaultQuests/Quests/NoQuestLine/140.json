Yes this is above 32EU/t, but GT5 had special mechanics where certain machines such as this one could accept more than 1 Amp.\nIn GTCE, the Thermal Centrifuge was made to only work at MV with 60EU/t recipes.\nAnd now to be honest with you... it was awful, never worth it. So we buffed the machine to be much more relevant.",
