This is called the Cumene process.\n\nThe choice is yours:\n§91 -§r Great if you have §3Pyrolyse§r + §3Distillation Tower§r combo.\n§92 -§r My preference, you can use the §dSalt§r to make §dSalt Water§r and electrolyze it as a loop.\n§93 -§r Great if you have infinite supply of §dChlorine§r thanks to a §3Fluid Drilling Rig§r on Salt Water.\n§94 -§r §4Phosphoric Acid§r is a pain to produce and is only required for other things at §cZPM§r in GTCEu, unrecommended.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The Benzene + Oxygen recipe was added in GTCE as part of chemical fixes as the Large Chemical Reactor didn\u0027t exist.
