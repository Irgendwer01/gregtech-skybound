Maintenance in GregTech is not as bad as you think, and looking at multiblocks with this hatch makes me feel happy.§r\n\nMost Multiblocks require a §3Maintenance Hatch§r. You will need to do Maintenance for the Multiblock to begin operating.\nThis is done by having a §9Wrench§r, a §9Screwdriver§r, a §9Soft Mallet§r, a §9Hammer§r, a §9Wire Cutter§r, and a §9Crowbar§r in your inventory, opening the Maintenance Hatch and §eclicking the center spot once§r. §cNo need to move tools individually§r.\nAlternatively you can fix problems by placing a §9Tape§r in the Maintenance Hatch, but I would love to tell you that\u0027s unethical.\n\nMaintenance problems have a §d5%§r chance of occuring every §dhour of activity§r. Needless to say they are very rare. Each problem increases the recipe durations by 10%. Fixing the problems is done the same way as above.\n\n\nAt §6HV§r age, you will unlock other Maintenance Hatches that do not enforce fixing the problems manually.\n\n\n§bLore:§r Maintenance dates back to GregTech 3 for Minecraft 1.5.2. That\u0027s a long time ago!\nMaintenance problems increased power usage instead of duration. And that caused all sorts of \"happy\" issues. Ah, fun times!",
