      "desc:8": "The §3Large Chemical Reactor (LCR)§r is a multiblock §3Chemical Reactor§r with more input/output slots, which can handle more recipes thanks to Teflon.\n\nThe §3LCR§r can perform some exclusive reactions which allow you to combine multiple normal §3Chemical Reactor§r steps into a §6single step§r. Examples below:\n§9-§r §aNitrogen Dioxide§r (for Nitric Acid and Dinitrogen Tetroxide)\n§9-§r §aSulfuric Acid§r\n§9-§r §aPhenol§r\n§9-§r §aEpichlorohydrin§r (you need it for Epoxy§r!)\n§9-§r §aEpoxy§r\n\n\nThere are also §3LCR§r exclusive recipes. For example §aRadon§r requires it.\n\nAll §dOverclocks§r in the §3LCR§r are §6100% efficient§r; each overclock will §5quadruple the speed§r, as opposed to doubling it.\n\n\n§9Tip:§r Given the amount of LCRs you may end up using, I would recommend using the §dwallsharing§r to its full potential.\nYou may share one 2A (standard) §3Energy Hatch§r with 2 LCRs.\nYou may share §3Input/Output Hatches§r, but be careful to not make them run the wrong recipes.\nKeep in mind Maintenance is not sharable.\n\n\nThe §3LCR§r has yet another §6advantage§r. You can use §32 Energy Hatches§r to make it run recipe of the §5next tier§r, similarly to how you did it with the §3Electric Blast Furnace§r.",
