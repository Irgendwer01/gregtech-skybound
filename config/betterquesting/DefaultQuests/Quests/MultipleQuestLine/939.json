      "desc:8": "§oThe Cleanroom is a well isolated space, with little to no airborne particles, bacteria and other contaminants.§r\n\nThe §3Cleanroom§r is a hollow multiblock free of contaminants. Going forward, most new §acircuit-related recipes§r, as well as some unique things like §3Fusion Casings§r, will need to be run in machines inside a Cleanroom.\n\nCreating it will put a test to your §aPolyethylene§r automation for all the §dPlascrete§r and/or §dCleanroom Glass§r you will make.\n\n\n§2§lThe Structure:§r\n\nBe sure to check the §9tooltip§r (a lot of information in there!).\nThe Controller always has to be in the center. The rest of the top layer has to be §dFilter Casings§r.\nAll edges have to be §dPlascrete§r, and the sides can be §dCleanroom Glass§r.\nPlacing §3Generators§r or §3Mufflers§r inside is §cnot allowed§r. The Cleanroom will unform.\nDo not forget the §3Maintenance Hatch§r.\nIf the structure refuses to form, rotate or replace the Controller, it can be a bit finicky.\nWe will start off with a 5x5x5 Cleanroom, but you should upgrade its size when you start feeling cramped inside. It does not have to be a cube.\n\n§2§lGetting things in and out:§r\n\nTransfer EU using §3Hulls§r or §3Diodes§r.\nItem and Fluid transfer can be done using §3Passthrough Hatches§r.\n§3Machine Hulls§r count as §6ME Cables§r to extend your ME Network inside your Cleanroom.\nThe §dDoor(s)§r can remain open (not very realistic, but convenient).\n\n§2§lThe Mechanics:§r\n\nThe Cleanroom starts §4contaminated§r. While contaminated, machines will not be able to operate.\nThe Cleanroom will drain 30EU/t and slowly increase the cleanliness.\nOnce §9Clean§r, recipes can run. At that point it will only draw 4EU/t. Keep it powered at all times or it will get dirty again!\nThe bigger the Cleanroom, the longer it takes to become Clean.\n\n§9Note§r: When the time comes, Multiblocks must also be put into Cleanrooms in order to run cleanroom recipes! §5\n\n§9§eConfigs:§r If you dislike the Cleanroom mechanics, it can be toggled off in the config file with §5\"B:enableCleanroom\"§r. Multiblocks can be made to ignore cleanroom requirements with §5\"B:cleanMultiblocks\"§r. We encourage you to try it out before deciding.\n§\n\n§bLore:§r The Cleanroom comes from GregTech 5. But as with many features, it is more punishing in that version. The recipes would simply run, but had a % chance of completion equal to the cleanliness of the Cleanroom. This caused a lot of accidental voiding! Furthermore, if the Cleanroom had a maintenance issue, the cleanliness would cap out at 90%, which means voiding 10% of items!\nGTCEu Cleanroom will §6never void§r recipe outputs.",
