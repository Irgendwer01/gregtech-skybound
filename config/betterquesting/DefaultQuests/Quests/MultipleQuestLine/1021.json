I promise. GTCEu\u0027s ultimate battery uses 16 UV orbs. GTNH\u0027s only uses 8. However, GTNH also has a §lReally Ultimate Battery§r made of 8 Ultimate Batteries! It\u0027s not useful at all, but still exists... They recently added an §lExtremely Ultimate Battery§r made of 8 Really Ultimate Batteries, which is ludicrously expensive.",
