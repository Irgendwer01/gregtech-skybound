      "desc:8": "§oTitanium has the highest corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio of any metallic element.§r\n\n§aTitanium§r is the main material for §5EV§r machines. Be sure you build your closed loop for Rutile and prepare to run a dedicated §3EBF§r for hours.\n\nIt also is the first material requiring an §6HV§r §9Vacuum Freezer§r to cool. You won\u0027t need to upgrade your freezer\u0027s power inputs as often as your EBF, but power requirements will still slowly go up, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe §5EV§r Age is the end for single block generators! You will need to run several §3HV Generators§r! And later upgrade to Multiblock Generators.\nWhile Multiblock generators are much more expensive, they have the ability to be much more energy efficient!",
