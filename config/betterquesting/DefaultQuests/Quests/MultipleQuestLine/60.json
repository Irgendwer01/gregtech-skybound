      "desc:8": "This Quest explains how §3Energy§2§f works in Gregtech.\n\nLike in real life, you have§2 Amperage§f and §2Voltage§f. Each §2§3Tier §fhas an specific amount of §2Voltage§f that it can handle maximum. For example, §e§2§2§3§eULV §2§fhas an §2Voltage§f of 16 §3EU {Energy Units§f§3}§f§f per tick, so it§f can handle all recipes that take up to 16 §3Energy Units§f per tick. Anything above is §2§eLV§f, which can handle up to 32 §3Energy Units §fper tick and so on.\nEach §2Cable§f also has an §3§2Voltage §floss per Block! Be sure to watch out for that!\n\n§2Amperage§f§2 {Amps} §ftakes the §3Energy Units§f§f xN, where N is the number of §2Amps§f. Each §2§3Tier §fhas x4 §3§3§2Amps§f of the lower §4§3Tier§f, so you can power as example an §2§3§eMV §fMachine with an §2Cable§f with §2§eLV §fpower that has x4 §2Amps§f or more.\n\nNOTE: While you can power an §2§eLV §fMachine with an §2§eLV§f §2Cable§f that has §2Amps§f higher than 1, but you can\u0027t power it with an §eMV §f§2Cable§f, it will EXPLODE! This has the reason that the §2Cable§f of the corresponding §3Tier§f will only output as much §3§2Voltage§f as the Machine needs.",
