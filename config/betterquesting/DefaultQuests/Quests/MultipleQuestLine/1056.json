Any energy that cannot be output will momentarily pause the multiblock.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The ECE comes from GT:NH. However... the story is not so great. The stats on the tooltip looked similar to this one, so far so good.\nHowever if you made calculations, you ended up realizing you needed to run around 16 whole HV Vacuum Freezers to keep up with Liquid Oxygen...\nThe one and only fuel it would accept is High Octane Gasoline, which was stated to be burned at 300% efficiency when boosted, but it was a lie! The efficiency remained 100%!\nThe GT:NH team recently decided to rework the ECE among other power options, phew!",
