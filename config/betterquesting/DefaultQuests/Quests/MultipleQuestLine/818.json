The Steel version is way too expensive right now, I would not recommend it.\n\nFluid transfer is done through the Controller block, or up to §atwo Valves§r.\nValves can §9auto-output§r by placing them on the §dbottom layer§r and making them §dface down§r (as always, use a §5Wrench§r to adjust their facing).\n\nUnlike §3Drums§r, they are not portable. But I bet you guessed that already...\n\n\nThis Quest rewards an extra §6Cove Oven§r. Place it next to an existing Coke Oven, they can §dshare walls§r.\n\n\n§bLore:§r Just like Drums, these multiblocks are ported from GregTech 6.",
