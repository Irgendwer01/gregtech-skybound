      "desc:8": "§oYour research adventures continue!§r\n\nThe §3Research Station§r is the upgrade to the Scanner. It is used for more advanced forms of research. It will allow you to perform research which requires §aData Orbs and Modules§r.\n\nWhen running the §3Research Station§r, energy and §9Computation§r is needed. The latter is provided through an §9HPCA§r, which is explained in the next quest. It is recieved with a §3Computation Data Reception Hatch§r. Note that only one Reception Hatch is allowed in a Research Station.\n\nThis multiblock needs computation §dsporadically§r, which means the recipe will not reverse progress if you don\u0027t supply enough. It will simply halt in-place. It will also not progress at all without meeting at least the minimum computation rate. The machine will still draw energy constantly, even when recieving no computation however.\n\nTo scan items, the process is relatively similar. In the §3Object Holder§r, place the target item in the center slot, and the data storage item in the other slot. Then provide computation, and the data storage item will be updated upon completion. When running, the target item will be Locked and cannot be removed.\n\n§eNote§r: To form this multiblock the §3Object Holder§r must face the controller.",
