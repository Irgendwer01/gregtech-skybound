You can have up to five of them.\nThe Hatch allows for automation. It will §dauto-export§r both Fluid and Items with it! It also works for insertion into the Coke Oven (you can use Hoppers).\n\n\nIf the Coke Oven happens to fully fill up on Creosote that you are not using, break and replace the Coke Oven block. Automated fluid voiding is available later in the game.\n\n\n§bLore:§r The concept of Multiblocks is very old in modded Minecraft. Think of IndustrialCraft 2\u0027s Nuclear Reactor, or Railcraft\u0027s Coke Oven; they were revolutionary at the time.",
