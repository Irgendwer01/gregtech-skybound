      "desc:8": "This prospector has a §6higher range§r than the §7LV§r one. You definitively want this!\n\nShift right-clicking on it will change the mod to §6Fluid Prospection§r.\nThis will tell you the base §dyield§r of Fluid veins, along with how full they are.\n\nThe §dVisualOres§r mod also tracks these fluid veins. Hit the toggle in the bottom left of the fullscreen map to see what veins you\u0027ve found!\n\n§9Reminder:§r The yield of §3Fluid Drilling Rigs§r is proportional to the fullness of the vein. When low enough, it defaults to yield defined in the json file.\n\n§9Tip:§r When the fullness drops below 30% (rough estimation), you can consider moving to another vein for the sake of power to yield efficiency. Aiming for the §3Advanced Fluid Drilling Rig§r in §5EV§r will be a nice goal, as not only it boosts the output significantly, but it also reduces the drain rate.\n",
