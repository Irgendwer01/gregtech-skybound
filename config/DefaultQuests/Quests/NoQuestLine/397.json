It\u0027s the default icon for BetterQuesting Quests... this time used accordingly.§r\n\n§aNether Stars§r are used for high tier §dSensors§r, §dEmitters§r and §dField Generators§r.\n\nYou can also use them for §dBeacons§r, if you desire the permanent potion effects. Vanilla for you!\n\nOn the topic of §aNether Air§r which is required in the recipe: you can consider §9Liquid Nether Air§r Distillation if you wish, it\u0027s... decent.\n\n§bLore§r: In GTNH, you need a Nether Star Block in HV to get to the moon! You could also duplicate them with magic, and mine an ore for nether star dust much later on.\n\n§oDid you know the vanilla Nether Star texture isn\u0027t centered?§r :)",
