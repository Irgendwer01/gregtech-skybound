It has to be obtained from other Ores!§r\n\nTitanium requires a slightly more involved process than the previous materials to process. First you need §aRutile§r, obtained from §aBauxite§r.\nThe next steps are described in the next Quest. No need to rush things.\n\nBauxite is also an §6excellent source of Aluminium§r.\n\nGoing to §dThe End§r will give you access to a better Bauxite vein, as well as §9Ilmenite§r, an even better source of Rutile.\n\n\n§9Tip:§r Ore processing for §aBauxite§r is ridiculously good! Doing the §3Thermal Centrifuge§r step will easily §6triple§r your §aRutile§r yield.",
