It\u0027s very easy to make: just centrifuge some §9Pu-239§r to separate some out!\n\nIn the future, this material will require a §dNuclear Reactor§r to produce, but that\u0027s not in GTCEu yet.\n\n§bLore§r: In GT Impact, making Pu-241 was a challenge. Your first Pu-241 had to be produced as a byproduct of its very expensive Naquadah fuel process, and it could only be made independently with something post-fusion!",
