This means you will get a total of §632x§r as much Oil (or whatever fluid) from a bedrock fluid vein until depletion!\n\nEven when depleted, you can still use this and be very power positive.\n\nOne single §3Advanced Fluid Drilling Rig§r should be enough to supply Power for a base up to §dLuV§r Age and possibly beyond!\n\nAs a §9reminder§r from the Quests that appeared in §bMV§r:\n§9-§r §aLight Oil§r can be used for §dLPG§r and §dMethane§r, to run in §3Large Gas Turbines§r.\n§9-§r §aOil§r can be used for §dDiesel§r and §dCetane-Boosted Diesel§r, to run in §3Large Combustion Engines§r.\n§9-§r §aHeavy Oil§r can be used for §dNitrobenzene§r, to run in §3Large Gas Turbines§r.",
