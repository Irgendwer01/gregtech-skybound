It is achieved with §3two LV Energy Hatches§r. Each one takes 2 Amps of LV, so that\u0027s 4 Amps of LV for 128EU/t maximum power.\n\n\n§9Note:§r Be wary of Cable §closses§r bringing the actual power input below the recipe requirement! I §lhighly§r recommend placing your §3Battery Buffer§r next to the §3Energy Hatches§r for the minimum cable length.",
