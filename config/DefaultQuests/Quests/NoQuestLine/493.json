Energy is transferred in §dPackets§r, or p.\n\n- §dPower§r is measured in EU per tick (EU/t). §dVoltage§r is measured in volts (V), which are EU/p. §dAmperage§r is measured in amperes (A), which are p/t.\n\n§bLore§r: Before EU and RF, there were Minecraft Joules (MJ), the native energy system for BuildCraft. When EU was introduced, it was calculated that 2.5 EU \u003d 1 MJ based on how much energy their coal generators made. Then when RF was introduced with Thermal Expansion 3, it was defined that 10 RF \u003d 1 MJ. Therefore 1 EU \u003d 4 RF by default.",
