Let me grab my script.§r\n\n\nYes! This is indeed not completable yet, which is also why this quest appears in the §6HV§r Chapter.\n\nRemember the thing about Macerator I told you that made you feel unextremely sad and disappointed? Well... that disappointment is gonna keep going until then.\n\n§6The Macerator will unlock its second and third slot at HV§r. And this will be great for Ore Processing. In fact if you check the Ore Processing JEI page, you will see that one byproduct is absolutely locked by this, after the Thermal Centrifuge step.\n\n§cNote:§r Unlike in GTCE, the §bMV§r Macerator in GTCEu does §cnot§r have a second slot!\n\n\n§5Writer:§r §oCome back to me when you are stronger, young Padawan.§r",
