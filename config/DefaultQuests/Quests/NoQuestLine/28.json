The bests you can make right now are §2Tin §fand§2 Bronze§f ones.\n\nYou can see in their description which can transfer Items and which can transfer Fluids, it also depends on the Material.\n\nNOTE: Output Hatches and Buses from Multiblocks will auto-insert into Pipes, but be sure that the output face is showing where the Pipe is, else it won\u0027t auto-insert!",
