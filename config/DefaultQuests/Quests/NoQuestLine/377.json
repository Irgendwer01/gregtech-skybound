Setup a system to recover them and you can process an indefinite amount of Rutile in a closed loop!\n\n\n§aTitanium Tetrachloride§r also acts as a catalyst in Plastics production. A small amount of §aTiCl₄ §rin the polymerisation process increases the polymer yield to §6133%§r§r. This is totally and completely optional, though.\n",
