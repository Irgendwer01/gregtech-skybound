They require an §9Assembly Line§r, many different forms of materials, and lots of fluids too!\n\nYou will notice that §9Samarium§r is required for §aLuV+ Motors§r. Samarium is on its own not very difficult to obtain, but smelting it is slightly more involved. It requires §9Liquid Helium§r in the Freezer. You may have seen this already, if you made §9IV Superconductors§r.\n\n§bLore:§r In the original GregTech 5, these components were unobtainable!",
