For example, you can convert HV to LV power directly, by using the appropriate energy hatches.\n\nIt also has a second function, detailed in the next quest.\n\n§bLore§r: This is yet another feature from TecTech, which also required these cables to be painted. They too look really good if you paint them, but it is again optional.",
